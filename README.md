# EFIS-AvionicsDuino
This is the software of the EFIS main module described here https://avionicsduino.com/index.php/en/efis-2/

This module is based on a PJRC Teensy 4.1 board.



WARNING!

Version 3.0 or later of this software should only be used with the EFIS_remote_ module software version 2.0 or later and the AHRS software version 2.0 or later. This is due to major modifications to the CAN bus configuration required after removing the UART serial communication line that previously existed between the EFIS and the AHRS. Version 2.5 should be used with EFIS_Remote_Module V 1.0 and AHRS V 1.3.
